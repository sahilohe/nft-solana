#### Sorry guys, the code is not updated! Don't use my code in your project files! follow the project notes.

## Metaplex error fix

clone the metaplex repo `git clone https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex.git`
run `sudo yarn install --cwd ~/metaplex/js/` (I'm working on WSL2)
then run `ts-node ~/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts --version`. this command should spit out `0.0.2`

make sure that all your assests and .config files are all correct

run this command `ts-node ~/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -cp config.json ./assets`
from the root of the project folder, where you have put the assests folder.

you will set similar result

then run this command  `ts-node ~/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts verify_upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json` to verify your nfts are uploaded or not

that's it! the rest works! follow up the project notes properly!
